The GDB database library is used in building the whatsup programs.
GDB's libgdb.a should be built and installed prior to making the
whatsup programs.  

The makefiles supplied with whatsupinclude a -L load flag (see CFLAGS
in the main Makefile) to indicate a directory to be searched for
-lgdb.  As supplied, this points to ../gdb_distribution, which is what I
use for testing.  Assuming GDB is in /usr/lib, then the explicit -L
can be deleted entirely.

Also, since the RT/PC does not currently support the -L flag, alternate
suggested Makefile flags are provided as comments.  Look in the main
Makefile and also those in the whatsup and postit subdirectories.

Note that GDB normally requires that -lhesiod be specified when loading 
a GDB application, so the Makefiles supplied with this distribution
make that specification.  While GDB and whatsup can be built without 
Hesiod support, that is discouraged.  See the GDB README file for 
instructions on building GDB without Hesiod support.  Once that is done,
the -lhesiod can be removed from the whatsup and postit Makefiles.

The makefiles use GNUemacs to byte compile a set of Emacs macros.  Emacs
should be installed and available when the make is run.

The GDB server named dbserv is normally used in conjunction with the
whatsup programs, but it is not necessary for their installation.

Each of these programs accesses by default a database named whatsup-mit,
which should be registered with Hesiod as a GDB database (see GDB documentation
for instructions.)  Again, this need not be done when installing the whatsup
programs, only when attempting to use them.

/*		Making the Whatsup Calendar Programs
/*	
/************************************************************************/

To build whatsup, postit, and bulkpost:

	% make all

There is also support for:

	% make clean		<= clean up the directories
	% make depend		<= rebuild the dependency information
				   in the make files
	% make lint		<= run lint on all the whatsup programs 
	% make install		<= normally used only by the Athena
			     	   staff.  Installs whatsup in its usual
				   place(s) at Athena

/************************************************************************/

/*	Installing the Whatsup Programs
/*	
/************************************************************************/

The Makefiles provided with whatsup are designed for installations to
be done by the release engineering staff at Project Athena.  In
particular, a:

	% make DESTDIR=/ABC install

will create the following files:

	/ABC/usr/unsupported/whatsup			<= whatsup query pgm
	/ABC/usr/unsupported/postit		   	<= interact. update pgm
	/ABC/usr/unsupported/bulkpost			<= bulk update pgm
	/ABC/usr/unsupported/bulkpost.longform		<= blank form for users
	/ABC/usr/unsupported/bulkpost.shortform		<= blank form for users
	/ABC/usr/unsupported/postit.el			<= emacs macros
	/ABC/usr/unsupported/postit.elc			<= compiled macros
	/ABC/usr/man/man1/whatsup.1			<= man page
	/ABC/usr/man/man1/postit.1			<= man page
	/ABC/usr/man/man1/bulkpost.1			<= man page

where the /ABC is the directory specified as DESTDIR on the make command.
To change the directories in which the files are placed, you must edit the 
Makefiles.  The Makefiles presume that all required directories have been
created before the make install is run.

If you are making whatsup for private use, do a:

	% make all

instead of a make install.  The whatsup programs will be in the whatusp and postit subdirectories, .h in include, and so on.  

/************************************************************************/
/*	
/*	Formatting documentation
/*	
/************************************************************************/

Man pages are provided for each of the three programs  These are installed
automatically on a make install.  To just format them:

	% cd doc          	   <= Assuming you were in the main directory
	% make whatsup.man postit.man bulkpost.man    <= runs the man pages
							 through nroff

You can 'more' the resulting .man files.

/************************************************************************/
/*	
/*			Miscellaneous Files
/*	
/************************************************************************/

In addition to the three programs, several other files required by
users are installed automatically with the system.  

Two of these are blank forms available as samples for users of bulkpost.
The others are a set of Emacs macros which postit and bulkpost load 
automatically to make life easier for users.  It is presumed that all
of these get installed in /usr/unsupported.  If the emacs macros are used,
then the EMACSMACS preprocessor variable in postit.h must be changed.
If the blank forms are moved, then the bulkpost man page should be
updated.
