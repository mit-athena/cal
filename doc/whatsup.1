.TH WHATSUP 1 "26 August 1987" "Project Athena"
.SH NAME
whatsup - MIT calendar of events
.SH SYNOPSIS
whatsup
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Whatsup
is an interactive calendar of events for the MIT community.
Anyone with access to Project Athena computers can post events on the 
calendar, or find out what is happening at any given time in the coming
year.  Keep in mind that the listings you read in the calendar may
have come from most anyone, so they may not all be accurate.  Use the
calendar information at your own risk (or correct it yourself if you
are sure it's wrong!)
.PP
The
.I whatsup
program is used to browse the calendar and
.I postit,
which has its own man page,
is used to post or change event listings.
You can also use whatsup to write your own file containing just the
event listings that interest you.  The program normally lives
in the /usr/unsupported directory on the Project Athena 
systems, which means that you can invoke it by issuing the command:
.PP
.in +15
/usr/unsupported/whatsup
.in -15
.PP
If your display looks garbled when you invoke whatsup, it almost 
surely means that your TERMCAP entry is not set properly for your
terminal.  Ask a Project Athena consultant to help you configure
your terminal properly.  If the vi editor works properly on your
terminal, then whatsup should too.  Also, make sure your window is at
least 24 lines long and 80 lines wide, or whatsup will refuse to start.
.PP
You may exit from whatsup at anytime during its operation by typing
.I CTRL-C
(i.e. hold down the CTRL key and press C at the same time.)
.SH GETTING HELP
A 
.I message line 
near the top of the whatsup screen gives you hints about how to use
the program.  The line changes as you interact with the program;
if you're lost, start by reading the message line.
.PP
If the message line doesn't tell you what you need to know, press
the
.I ?
key.  Like the message line, the help supplied by ? varies according
to what you're doing.
.SH SEARCHING FOR EVENTS IN THE CALENDAR
.PP
Whatsup starts by presenting a screen on which you may supply
information about the portions of the calendar you're interested
in seeing. 
From this screen you should
.I type over the appropriate fields to:
.in +5
.PP
1) Specify the days you're interested in.
.br
2) Specify times of day to be checked.
.br
3) (optional) indicate the types of events you interested in.
.br
4) Press the 
.I *
key to initiate a search of the calendar.
.in -5
.PP
.I DEFAULTS
are supplied for you for all fields.  If you just invoke whatsup and
press * to begin a search, all events starting immediately
and continuing to the end of the day will be retrieved.
If the events you're interest in finding fall within the coming week,
then the day fields provide a convenient means of specifying the dates.
Just type
.I M 
for Monday and so on.
If you specify a
.I STARTING DAY
it will be presumed to fall within the next 7 days. (e.g. if today is
THU, then FRI will be tomorrow and WED will be 6 days off.)
If you type an
.I ENDING DAY 
it will be presumed to fall within the 7 days following the
starting day.
.PP
.I DATES
always refer to the coming year; you cannot search for events which happened 
yesterday.  
You may may type over the starting and ending date fields to change
their values.  Dates take the following forms:
.PP
.in +15
3/25        March 25th
.br
22          22nd of the same month
.in -15
.PP
You may also indicate the 
.I TIMES of DAY
that interest you.  Legal specifications for time include:
.PP
.in +15
You type this            To get
.br
-------------            ------
.br
9 or 9A or 9:00          9:00 AM
.br
8P or 8:00P or 20:00     8:00 PM
.br
3:15P or 15:15           3:15 PM
.br
2:25  or 2:25A           2:25 AM
.br
N or 12N                 Noon
.br
M or 12M                 Midnight
.in -15
.PP
.I IMPORTANT:
the time range is applied to each day separately.  For example, a search
of MON thru FRI 3PM to 5PM would search 2 hours on each of 5 days.
.PP
Specification of an 
.I EVENT TYPE
is optional, and you should probably not try it until you are familiar
with the basic operation of the calendar.  If no type is specified, or
if you blank out the type field (with the SPACE BAR), then all events
at the designated times will be retrieved.  One of the shortcomings of
the current version of whatsup is that there is no easy way to learn
the type codes which have been used;  the best way to find them is
to look at some of the events in the calendar.  The type code is shown
in parenthesis on the scrollable selection screen, and also on the 
event details display.  
.SH THE EVENT LIST
If your search succeeds in finding some events, then you will be shown
a selection screen with one line for each event.  Using the keys
indicated on the screen, you can move the cursor to the line for
any event which interests you.  You should then press
.I S
to get details about the event.
.SH EVENT DETAILS
The event details screen shows all the information which was entered into
the calendar for a given event, except that only the specific time
listing you select is shown.  
.SH WRITING EVENT DETAILS TO A FILE
.PP
If you press the 
.I F
key while viewing event details, the complete listing for the event
will be appended to a local file named "whatsup.items".  You may print
this file or keep it around to provide a convenient summary of the events
that interest you most.  You may also edit or delete the file as you
see fit.
.SH CUSTOMER RESPONSES
.PP
A mailing list named `whatsup' has been set up at Project Athena.  Please send
your questions and your comments.  DO NOT SEND EVENT ANNOUNCEMENTS TO
THAT LIST.
.SH POSTING EVENTS ON THE CALENDAR
.PP
Whatsup is an open calendar; any Athena user can post or change event
listings using the
.I postit program.
Use the command
.I man postit
for information on posting events to the calendar.
.SH CAVEATS
The whatsup system is experimental;  we hope that it will provide 
a new way for the MIT Community to keep in touch and to find out
what is happening around town.   We cannot be responsible for innaccuracies
in the information posted on the calendar, for errors in the calendar
programs, for accidental loss of posted event listings, 
or for periodic unavailability of the system.  Your comments
and suggestions are urgently solicted.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Uses the curses program.  It does not understand mice or the X window
system.  You MUST have your TERMCAP entry set properly or your screen
will be garbage.  (CTRL-C to get out.)
.PP
If you're telnet'ing from a PC or PC/AT, you must turn on the
telnet wrap option or your screen will not format properly (PRESS
F10 and w after starting telnet and before starting whatsup.  To
recover if you're already in whatsup, turn on wrap with F10/w and
then press CTRL-L, which forces whatsup to repaint its screen.)
.PP
CTRL-L is not documented.
.PP
There is no convenient way to find out about event type codes or
to enforce their consistent use.  Neither is there a way to make
event type synonyms (e.g. a search for movies should match on film
or screen).
.PP
If you do a search which retrieves hundreds of events, the system
may appear to hang for several minutes while the information is
retrieved.
.PP
Some curses bugs occasionally cause the scrollable selection screen
to be garbled.  Another curses bug on the RT causes minor disruption
in the main prompting panel at times.
.SH VERSION
This man page applies to whatsup version 0.5.
